## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced development environment, automated testing is essential for ensuring the quality of web applications. This project focuses on creating a robust testing framework that uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation. The Page Object Model (POM) pattern helps maintain clean and manageable code by separating test logic from page-specific actions.

## Features

- **Selenium WebDriver Integration**: Leverage the power of Selenium for browser automation.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organize code for better maintainability and readability.
- **TestNG Framework**: Utilize TestNG for managing test execution and reporting.
- **Java Language**: Write tests in Java for strong type-checking and performance.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Use a powerful IDE for development and debugging.
- **Form Validation**: Validate various input types on web forms.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SeleniumPom project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Subhasajib/SeleniumPom.git
   ```
   
2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA**: Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open the cloned project.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can manage dependencies using Maven or Gradle.

4. **Set Up WebDriver**: Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and set the path in your project.

5. **Run Tests**: Execute the tests using TestNG.

### Explanation of Directories

- **pages/**: Contains page classes that represent different pages of the application.
- **tests/**: Contains test classes that execute tests against the page objects.
- **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file for managing project dependencies.

## Technologies Used

This project employs several technologies:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **TestNG**: For managing test execution and reporting.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The IDE used for development.
- **Maven**: For dependency management.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly configured.
3. Open the TestNG XML file (usually named `testng.xml`).
4. Click on the green run icon to execute all tests.

For detailed test results, check the TestNG report generated after execution.
